# Who to Contact for Access

## 🚨 Important: I Cannot Provide These

I am an **AI assistant**, not a project admin. I **DO NOT** have:
- Access to Firebase credentials
- Access to the deployment URL
- Ability to add you to Firebase or Vercel projects

## 👥 Who CAN Help You

You need to contact the **project owner/admin** who has access to:

### For Firebase Credentials:
- The person who set up the Firebase project
- Someone with Firebase project admin access
- Your team lead or project manager

### For Vercel Access & Deployment URL:
- The person who deployed the project to Vercel
- Someone with Vercel project admin access
- Your team lead or project manager

**Subject: Need Firebase Credentials & Vercel Access**

Hi [Team Lead/Project Admin],

I'm trying to run the project locally and need:

1. **Firebase Credentials** - For my `.env.local` file:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID

2. **Vercel Access** - So I can see the deployment URL and environment variables
   - My email: [YOUR EMAIL]
   - Please add me to the Vercel project: "ali" or "appttt"

3. **Deployment URL** - The live web link for the project

Could you please:
- Share the Firebase credentials securely, OR
- Add me to the Firebase project ([YOUR EMAIL]), OR
- Add me to the Vercel project so I can access these myself

Thanks!

## 🔍 How to Find Project Admins

1. **Check GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Layan218/ali
   - Check "Contributors" or repository settings
   - Look for repository owners/admins

2. **Check Git History:**
   - Look at commit history to see who set up the project
   - Check who made the initial Firebase setup commits

3. **Ask Your Team:**
   - Contact your development team
   - Ask who manages the Firebase and Vercel projects

## ✅ Once You Get Access

After you receive the credentials:
1. Create `.env.local` file in project root
2. Add the Firebase config values
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. The project should work!

I can help verify your setup once you have the credentials.
