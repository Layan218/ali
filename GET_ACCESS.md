**Subject: Need Access to Firebase & Vercel for Local Development**

Hi team,

I'm trying to run the project locally but need:
1. Firebase credentials (for .env.local file)
2. Access to Vercel dashboard (to see deployment URL)

Could someone please:
- Add me to the Firebase project (email: [your-email])
- Add me to the Vercel project (email: [your-email])

## ⚠️ Important

**I (the AI assistant) cannot:**
- Access your Firebase credentials (they're not in the repo)
- Access your Vercel account
- Add you to Firebase or Vercel projects (only admins can do this)
- See the deployment URL (it's not in the repository)

**You need to:**
- Get credentials from Vercel dashboard (if you have access)
- Ask your team to add you to the projects
- Or ask your team to share the credentials/URL with you
